# Ho<sub>2</sub>wLow
Ho<sub>2</sub>wLow is an interface for a concept app that would allow college dorms to challenge each other to water saving competitions. The goal was to design an interface that would incentivize and enforce water-conserving behavior. Improving behavior around water usage is particularly relevant in a time of the severe drought in California. 

The idea for this project came from thinking of creative ways to use the Belkin WeMo Water to save water. Below is the description of how the WeMo Water works:

"WeMo Water senses the pressure changes that occur throughout your plumbing system every time you use water. Advanced, machine-learning-based algorithms then analyze these pressure changes.

First, WeMo Water identifies every fixture in your home - from shower, to toilet, to irrigation. Next, it logs when, and for how long, you use each fixture, and calculates how much water each consumes." -- Source: http://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7C042/

The WeMo Water supplies data that is accurate enough for water usage to be attributed to an individual using location information from their mobile devices. With this information, it should be possible to create a sense of accountability surrounding water usage.
